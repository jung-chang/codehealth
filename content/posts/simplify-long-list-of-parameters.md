Suppose we have a function that helps draw a rectangle with some initial characteristics provided as function arguments.

{{< red-code >}}
{{< highlight javascript >}}

function draw(x: number, y: number, height: number,
              width: number, color: string, 
              opacity: number, border: number) {
    // ...dawing logic
}

{{< /highlight >}}
{{< /red-code >}}

There are already seven parameters for this function and all of them are important and used to draw the rectangle. However, what happens when we want to add a new characteristic when drawing a rectangle?

A solution may be to continually increase the number of function parameters to support the new characteristics. A better solution is to simplify function parameters and group them appropriately.

{{< green-code >}}
{{< highlight javascript >}}

interface Rectangle {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  height: number;
  width: number;
}

interface Attributes {
  color: string;
  opacity: number;
  border: number;
}

function draw(rectangle: Rectangle, attributes: Attributes) {
  // ...dawing logic
}

{{< /highlight >}}
{{< /green-code >}}

By grouping the parameters into easily understandable interfaces, we **improve readability** of the function as well as **simplify future refactors** to accomodate new characteristics.

General rules for long list of parameters:

1. Avoid using more than five parameters for a single function.
2. Group similar parameters together appropriately that makes sense to the context.
3. Usually a large number of parameters indicate splitting up the function (see Single Purpose Functions).

Always think about simplifying code whenever possible to improve readability and maintainability!
