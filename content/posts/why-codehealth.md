**Codehealth.dev** provides advice and learnings for improving code health and writing great code, through educational, meme-y biweekly posts.

### What's Code Health?

Code health is a framework that guides the quality and the ease-of-use of your code base and its related systems, and can be broken down into 3 main components:

{{< green-code >}}

<b>Simplicity: </b> straightforwardness of the technical implementation and overall design

</br>

<b>Readability: </b> clarity annd digestibility of the code base and general flow of logic

</br>

<b >Maintainability: </b> the ability introduce code changes to fix and improve the system

{{< /green-code >}}

These components are a product of **best practices** in software development along with **coding conventions** for technical implementation and can lead to multiple benefits such as:

- **Minimizing technical debt:** using best practices and installing coding conventions will actively avoid accumulating any technical debt
- **Less error prone:** clean code can help developers avoid making mistakes and spending time on debugging, increasing velocity of progress
- **Investing in longevity:** well structured and documented code allows for easier implementation and augmentation of features
